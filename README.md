Emotion Classifier (Happy vs Sad)
This project is a deep learning-based image classification model that detects facial emotions from images and classifies them as either Happy or Sad. It uses a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow, and supports image preprocessing, training, evaluation, and real-time prediction.

Model Highlights
Binary classification: Happy 😊 or Sad 😢

Built using TensorFlow/Keras and OpenCV

Clean data pipeline using image_dataset_from_directory

Training logs integrated with TensorBoard

Visualizations for accuracy and loss metrics

Supports real-time prediction on test images

🗂️ Dataset Structure
Your image dataset should follow this structure:
data/
├── happy/
│   ├── happy1.jpg
│   ├── happy2.jpg
│   └── ...
├── sad/
│   ├── sad1.jpg
│   ├── sad2.jpg
│   └── ...
Accepted image formats: .jpeg, .jpg, .bmp, .png

🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Jatinalwariya/emotion-classifier-happy-vs-sad.git
cd Image-Classification
2. Install dependencies
pip install tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib
3. Prepare your dataset
Place your images in the data/ directory following the structure above.
4. Run the model
python main.py

📈 Training Results
After training, the model outputs training and validation loss and accuracy plots:

Metric	Description
Accuracy	Overall classification accuracy
Loss	Binary cross-entropy loss
Precision & Recall	Evaluated on the test set

🧪 Example Prediction
img = cv2.imread('test.jpg')
yhat = model.predict(np.expand_dims(resize/255, 0))

if yhat > 0.5:
    print("Predicted Class is Sad 😢")
else:
    print("Predicted Class is Happy 😄")
